- Clorophyl data (algae)

## Technological platforms 
### JALC Boat 

JALC Boat is a project aimed to create an aquatic robot educational platform. Its components are 100% free and designed with 3D printing for anyone to create, adapt or modify.

### Ocean Data Buoy Project 

It started as a small/cheap 3D printed buoy that could measure wave height and period data on the ocean, and evolved to who else could benefit from small/cheap wave buoys and what would happen if suddenly this technology could be used to network a bunch of these floating buoys together to get high fidelity wave data for areas of interest
